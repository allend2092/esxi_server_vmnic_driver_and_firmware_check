# ESXi NIC Compatibility Automation Project

## Overview
This project aims to automate the validation of Network Interface Card (NIC) drivers and firmware versions across a large VMware ESXi server infrastructure. The primary goal is to ensure that all NICs are compliant with VMware's Hardware Compatibility List (HCL), a requirement for maintaining support contracts with VMware.

## Implementation Plan

### Data Collection
- Initial data collection will be performed using the command `vmkchdev -l | grep vmnic` on each ESXi host.
- This command outputs details such as Vendor ID (VID), Device ID (DID), Subsystem Vendor ID (SVID), and Subsystem ID (SSID).
- Future plans include leveraging VMware PowerCLI and vCenter for data collection, which provides structured data and eliminates the need for text parsing.

### Hyperlink Generation
- The collected data (VID, DID, SVID, SSID) will be used to construct a dynamic URL to query VMware's HCL.
- Example URL format: `https://www.vmware.com/resources/compatibility/search.php?deviceCategory=io&details=1&releases=[RELEASES]&VID=[VID]&DID=[DID]&SVID=[SVID]&SSID=[SSID]&page=1&display_interval=10&sortColumn=Partner&sortOrder=Asc`
- The URL will be dynamically updated with the relevant data for each NIC.

### Considerations
- **Scripting**: Ensure robust scripting with error handling and data validation.
- **Output Handling**: Develop methods to parse and interpret the HCL webpage content.
- **Version Control**: Account for different ESXi versions and their respective compatibility requirements.
- **Security and Access**: Adhere to organizational security policies and access controls.
- **Testing**: Thoroughly test scripts in a controlled environment before production deployment.
- **Documentation and Maintenance**: Maintain clear documentation and regular updates to the script.

### Potential ChatGPT API Integration
- **Query Assistance**: Utilize the API for interpreting results and providing recommendations.
- **Report Generation**: Generate human-readable reports or summaries from the compatibility checks.

## Goals
- Automate the process of validating NIC drivers and firmware against VMware's HCL.
- Reduce manual effort and increase efficiency in large-scale virtualized environments.
- Ensure compliance with VMware support contract requirements.

## Future Scope
- Expand automation to include other aspects of VMware infrastructure management.
- Continuously improve and adapt the script to accommodate changes in VMware's environment and HCL.
